- BandPyrometry.jl module provides:
    - EmPoint type formulates the least-square problem to optimize the temperature of blackbody 
    - BandPyrometryPoint type formulates the least-square problem to optimize the temperature and spectral emissivity approximation to the real surface (with emissivity dependent on wavelength) formulates the least-square problem to optimize the temperature of blackbody 
    - Methods to solve the least-square optimization problem using zero,first and second order methods using optimizers provided by Optimization.jl package
